### **What is TBI?**

Traumatic brain injury, often known as a TBI is an injury that affect the way the brain functions. It can be caused by a bump, blow, jolt to the head or related injury. Depending on the severity of the injury TBI patients may experience health problems that last a few days or for the rest of their life.

Some of the symptoms of TBI:

* Headaches

* Dizziness

* Confusion

* Slurred speech

* Poor concentration

* Memory problems

* Personality changes
